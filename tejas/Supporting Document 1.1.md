<br>

*#1. Below code gives the example of **string** formatting*

    name = "Tom Hanks"  
    age = 1000  
    occupation = "actor"  
     
    print(f"My name is {name.upper()} and i'm {age} years old. I am an {occupation}")


*#2. Below code gives the example of the **update** function in dictionary*

    tom_hanks = {  
    "age1": 50,  
    "occupation1": "actor"  
    }  
      
    sachin_tendulkar = {  
    "age2": 40,  
    "occupation2": "cricketer"  
    }  
      
    amitabh_bachchan = {  
    "age3": 75,  
    "occupation3": "actor"  
    }  
      
    merged = {}  
    merged.update(tom_hanks)  
    merged.update(sachin_tendulkar)  
    merged.update(amitabh_bachchan)  
    print(merged)


*#3. Below code gives the example of **lambda** function and type annotations*

    from typing import List  
      
    def find_even_numbers(nums: List[int], test) -> List[int]:  
    other_numbers = []  
    for n in nums:  
    if test(n):  
    other_numbers.append(n)  
      
    return other_numbers  
      
    data = [34,23,-67,12,12]  
    print(find_even_numbers(data, lambda n: n % 2 == 0))  
      
    data.sort(key = lambda  n: abs(n))  
    print(data)


*#4. Below code gives the example of **slots** in classes for memory management*

    class  Immutable():  
    __slots__ = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']  
      
    def  __init__(self, a, b, c, d, e):  
    self.a = a  
    self.b = b  
    self.c = c  
    self.d = d  
    self.e = e  
    print(a, b, c, d, e)  
    
    im = Immutable(12, 34, 35, 54, 63)


*#5. Changing color of text*

    print("\033[93mThis is a different color")


*#6. Banker’s Rounding*

    print(round(11.5))
    

*#7. Opening a web page*

    import webbrowser  
    webbrowser.open("https://google.com")


*#8. Checking the memory address*

    data = "Hello"  
    print(id(data))


*#9. For deep copying*

    from  copy import deepcopy  
    fruits = ["Orange", "Apple"]  
    new_fruits = deepcopy(fruits)


*#10. Checking the existence of scope*

    def func():  
    data = []  
    print("data"  in locals(), "data"  in globals())  
      
    func()


*#11. Checking for data*

    data = ["Hello"]  
    print(not data)


*#12. Smart unpacking*

    data = [10, 20, 30]  
    print(*data)


*#13. Using the and / or operator in a list*

    reputation = 10  
    age = 15  
      
    conditions = [  
    reputation >= 9,  
    age >= 18  
    ]  
      
    if all(conditions): // use any for "or" condition  
    print("Admin")  
    else:  
    print("User")

*#14. Using sorted on non-primitive types*

    data = [  
    {"name": "Tom Hanks", "age": 60},  
    {"name": "Robert Downey Jr.", "age": 55},  
    {"name": "Scarlett Jo", "age": 30},  
    ]  
      
    print(sorted(data, key=lambda x: x["age"], reverse=True))

*#15. Using generators for better memory management*

    import sys  
      
    my_list = [x for x in range(10000)]  
    print(sum(my_list))  
    print(sys.getsizeof(my_list), "bytes")  
    // size ~ 90,000 bytes  
      
    my_gen = (x for x in range(10000))  
    print(sum(my_gen))  
    print(sys.getsizeof(my_gen), "bytes")  
    // size 128 bytes

*#16. Fetching data from dictionary (the right way)*

    my_dict = {  
    "item": "football",  
    "price": 100  
    }  
      
    count = my_dict.get("count", 0)  
    print(count)  
      
    count = my_dict.setdefault("count", 0)  
    print(count)  
      
    print(my_dict)
